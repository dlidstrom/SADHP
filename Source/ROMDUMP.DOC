To use SADHP for disassembling HP48 ROM you need to have a ROM dump.
SADHP assumes the ROM dump is a file containing 1 nibble of data for each
byte. If you have a pre-existing ROM dump but which contains 2 nibbles of
data for each byte then modify sport.c to ignore the stripping of the leading
16 nibbles and use the it to get a valid dump for SADHP. Else follow below
instructions.


Dump alternative 1:

   On your HP48 KGET (or type in) the DUMP program included in
Dump.RPL. The checksum should be # 5149h and the size 72. This program
takes two arguments: start and end addresses. It will dump memory,
using the PEEK program posted Mar 16, 1990 by Alonzo Gariepy. Make
sure to set the word size to 64 first, with `64 STWS'. Direct I/O to
WIRE, make sure your computer is set to capture the dump. Hook up your
HP48, and type in #0h #6FFF0h DUMP. DUMP will continually display the
currect dump address in the top left corner of the display, which will
otherwise remain blank apart from the menu.

   DUMP will take a long time. The the entire ROM dump is about 450
kilobytes - so try and use as high speed as possible. 

   The utility dump2core will convert your dump to a core file named
.core, which is what the disassembler will be looking for. It reads
the dump from standad input, and overwrites .core if it exists;
otherwise a new one will be created. 

[Note: the dump consists of records of two lines each. The first is
the address, the second the data as returned by PEEK. Dump2core
ignores the address part, it's included only to serve as a reference
for you, to allow you to retransmit smaller portions, should it prove
necessary. You are recommended to verify that the dump is correct; the
following command will list all clobbered lines, if any, along with
their line numbers:

		grep -vn '^# [0-9A-F]+h$' romdump                       ]


Dump alternative 2:

Enter memory scanner mode (thus this method does not work for G/GX). Hook up
you HP48 to your computer, and make sure the HP48 output is captured in a
file. Use the scanner to continuously dump 00000-7FFFF by first pressing
ENTER followed by / and then keep pressing SPC until done.
