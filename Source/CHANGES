This is SADHP 1.00. Modifications to SAD 1.03:
- HP mnemonics
- port memory with formats and comments (+ sport as a primitive tool)
- Revised standard .formats and .symbols and .macros based on information in
  entries.all (Usually at seq.uncwil.edu:/hp48/hardware/entries.tar.Z)
- Library link table is scanned for marking labels. No hash table scanning yet.


This is SADHP 1.01. Modifications to SADHP 1.00
- Revised rpl disassembly, rpl prologs now have default disassemblys that can
  be overridden with .macros
- Added .symbols1, .symbols2, .formats1 and .formats2
- New option -G to hinder grob drawing
- Global labels are now preferred over local ones
- Revised some formats declarations + added new ones
- Fixed GOYES and GOSBVL disassembly
- Fixed disassembly of 81* instructions
- Changed usage of PTR in disassembly
- Reprogrammed library disassembling, hash table is now scanned for labels


This is SADHP 1.02. Modifications to SADHP 1.01
- Fixed disassembly of tagged objects
- Fixed disassembly of 9* A* and B* instructions
- Fixed disassembly of invalid strings, nullgrobs and null strings
- Fixed disassembly of ?ST=0 and ?ST=1 instructions
- Fixed nibb data disassembling for structures where lookahead is used
- Fixed detecting end of file (caused system dependant errors)
- Added ROMPTR header detection (during rpl disassembly only)
- Added ROMPTR naming system to disassembly & .symbols file
- d option now lists possible ROMPTR table too if C option is used
- added M option
- Added ENDCODE 'labels' to keep track of code objects embedded in code objects


This is SADHP 1.03. Modifications to SADHP 1.02
- Added hash/link table disassembly (formats 'h' and 'l')
  SAD autoformats hash/link tables when disassembling library header
- Added property comments
- Added recognition for end of machine language (some rpl prologs)
- Fixed -s option disassembly (CON(5) statements in expressions)
- Fixed disassembly of backup objects (+libdat and other similar obs)
- Added option -e to disassemble entries in .symbols
- Added possible lenght of entry disassembly
- Fixed major comment indentation.
- Added self-corrective indentation at composite start/end points
- Changed commenting style for unsupported entries
- Added more comments for jumps
- Fixed GOSUB detection for GOSUB: and GOTO: words
- Fixed disassembly of NOP instructions
- Changed -g to -L (no local symbols)
- Added -g to draw grob after source lines. Implies user has no screen resize
  features and draws max 68 pixels on each line (17 nibbles)
- Added error detection for a missing formats file. Caused core dumps.


This is SADHP 1.04. Modifications to SADHP 1.03
- Fixed romptr header disassembly
- Modified LC(n) and LA(n) disassembly to avoid unnecessary labels due to
  loading constants. Now only LC(5) and LA(5) create labels.
- Fixed -e option to error if symbol value is a rom pointer definition.
- a option forces tracking of current mode to print out ASSEMBLE and RPL
  at correct locations
- Revised label printing to use code/rpl format to avoid unnecessary
  ASSEMBLE-RPL pairs. Mode change is printed between major comments and
  labels, except if the only label is a local one. This choice gives the
  'natural' order for data disassembly where offsets are used.
- Removed CODE lenght from disassembly. Fixed ENDCODE location.
  CODE now displays lenght in comment field, not REL statement
- Added option -A. Now the source is a big mess..
  Specially treated:
	- Grobs drawn after source
	- Arrays in rplcomp format
	- rpl lines collected, macros %e and %n cut lines
	- Comments off, NULLNAME and xNAME used
	- Only prop data is printed before xNAMEs
	- Library header my own style
	- ROMPTR calls labeled according to NULLNAME/xNAME definitions
	- Link & hash tables not disassembled if in library mode
	- Only unsupported words given for -d
- Changed names given from xHASH,   xMESG,  xLINK,   xCONFIG
                        to LibHash, LibMsg, LibLink, LibCfg
- Added %n macro to force newline
- Added %N macro to force newline before & after word (= %n%0e )
- Added %e macro for allowing W words on the same line (after current entry)
- Added %E macro for dispatch structures W = words on line, A = max lines
  No nesting to previous composite levels :(
  But luckily dispatchers usually have same macros :)
- Fixed xNAME declarations to remove leading 'x' from names
- Fixed real number disassembly causing 'A' to appear in negative exponents.
- Fixed LA() disassembly
- Fixed xTITLE disassembly to match RPL++ source (No delimiters around title)
- Changed null string disassembly to $ "" from NIBHEX sequence
- Added 'A' format to mark ascii lines ending in newline or \00.
  Width means maximum lenght of line, default is 40. Strings longer than 80
  chars are printed with this method to get better looks.
- Fixed bug in adding auto formats that caused overriding .formats
- Fixed separator line printing
- Fixed handling of suspected references
- Added GX support via -X option or .core recognition
- Added skipob() to improve -e option
- Added BSS statement and automatic recognition for it in rpl mode
- Changed ABS statement to appear only if -a or -A was specified
- Removed xcom, xsym, sadfmt and sad.el, splitted sad.c

This is SADHP 1.05. Modifications to SADHP 1.04
- Added format 'L' for ROM resident libraries
- Changed LibHash etc to LibHash<libnum>
- Changed ROMPTR disassembly in arrays to use CON(6)
- Changed symbols, comments & xref output slightly
- Added xfmt, xcom, xsym, sad.el (Do not modify sad.el!!)
- Added disassembler for linked arrays
- Fixed LCHEX and LAHEX disassembly (amazingly nobody noticed the hxs string
  was reversed...)
- Fixed 'L' disassembly not to autoformat a CRC to the end
- Fixed xcom, xsym, sad.el
- Fixed a bug in comment output with -A option that caused rpl to be printed
  after the comment
- Fixed DupAndThen special prolog recognition
- Removed option -o to get dataoffsets
- Added recognition for patterns "A=PC LC(5) offset" and "C=PC  LA(5) offset"
  to get labels for data/code

This is SADHP 1.06. Modifications to SADHP 1.05
- Changed -A mode to use the tabulator in code disassembly
- Improved grob output for 'g' format character
- Improvement comment handling for essential info (like below)
- Added LCSTR/LASTR comments when ascii arg is suspected

This is SADHP 1.07. Modifications to SADHP 1.06
- Started HP49G support
- Added Flashptr support "FLASHPTR x y"

This is SADHP 1.08. Modifications to SADHP 1.07
- Changed Flashptr output from FLASHPTR to FPTR
- Fixed a bug in REL(x) output when negative offset is used
- Added -8 option for forcing HP48 disassembly
